A classic\r\nMcCullogh Pitts neural network. Numerical style. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"NN.jpg\"></img>\r\n\r\n1) Updated with some additional versions, moving towards generalizing the calculations\r\ninto matrix form.\r\n2) added a simple matrix class, would replace with BLAS or something (maybe eigen)\r\n3) added a class to load the iris dataset and process into a form ready to use in a neural network\r\n4) added some optimizations including momentum term, and learning rate heuristic tuning to prevent\r\noscillatory behavior with higher learning rate. This can be viewed in version 5 of the function.",
